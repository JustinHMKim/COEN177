Course Objectives

Develop the ability to:

        -Understand the basic OS functionality: CPU scheduling, process management, main memory management, secondary storage management, I/O devices, file management, security.
  
        -Apply the concepts in process management, such as allocating resources to processes, handling inter-process communication, multi-threading, deadlock detection and avoidance.
  
        -Apply the concepts in memory management, such as paging, segmentation and virtual memory, including page replacement algorithms.  Know the implementation technique for MINIX or some actual operating system.
  
        -Apply the concepts in file management, such as directory structure, layout management, buffering, and data space management.
  
        -Have hands on experience with the implementation of schedulers, memory managers, and file-systems algorithms.  Modify and extend an operating system such as MINIX.
  
        -Understand performance measurements and the importance of performance evaluation in operating system design.
